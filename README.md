# Plant_Simulation
This is a simulation program for a plant with a specific assembly line pattern. The project is compatible with C++ 14, 17, and 20 standards, and Visual Studio 2022 is used as the compiler. The program utilizes various techniques, such as mutex, condition variables, threads, atomic, file operations, and data structures, to implement multiple workers as threads working simultaneously in their own processes. Two types of workers work together to produce products that meet the given orders.
